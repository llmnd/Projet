                <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was an American professional boxer and cultural icon. 
                    He is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time.
                     Ali was known for his powerful punches, quick footwork, and charismatic personality.
                     He won the world heavyweight championship three times and an Olympic gold medal.
                      Outside the ring, Ali was an outspoken advocate for civil rights and social justice.
